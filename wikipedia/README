Also: edit counts

* using wikipedia_articles.csv

lowercase
discard line if title eq redirect due to lowercasing
discard line if title has more than N spaces

* fast matcher

lowercase, go word by word, building unigram, bigram, trigram for
lookup in an exact-match table
drop a trailing comma: "ballads," but not "John Doe, Jr."
maybe drop a trailing period: "John Doe, Jr." vs "ballads."
what to do about subset matches? choices
 yes* advance whenever there is a match: Broadside Ballad means go to the word after Ballad
 no* do nothing special: Broadside Ballad will always also match Ballad {big FAIL for people with Socrates in their names}
 no* smart drops: Broadside Ballad Monger can match "Broadside Ballad" and "Ballad Monger" but not Ballad

weirdnesses
"Mary Darwin" is a redirct to "Charles Darwin"
"List of foo"s have all kinds of things on the lists pointing at them
